3437,WfHG_hi2phA,53.45432655849215,58.40595678015489,for a guy who has a high body count he  had that's I believe it was Sterling I'm  saying this is that that is like one of  the highest uh ways of demonstrating  higher value or uh pre-selection that's  what it was because if a guy knows his  way around your body better than you do  you know he [ __ ] you know that he has  been rewarded by other men or other men  other women who uh who have had sex with  him in the past enough so he has the  experience to know what he's doing in  the bedroom right so there's that aspect  but then the other part of it is this is  that the reason why promiscuity works  one way for men and it does not work for  women is because of that paternity

3439,KMsq4Yh7tFM,54.44469952937724,65.91888941988731,there's not a lot of depictions of  strong masculine men in the media you  know you look you look at like  sitcoms for example and it's usually  like the kind of dunce kind of guy who's  a up you know look at The Simpsons  right strong wife the husband's an idiot  um you know these are this is like kind  of a more nuanced uh  talking point when it comes to men's  advocacy but men are in in media are  typically portrayed  especially in a lot of Comedy type stuff  sorry guys my neck is bugging me so I  got a nice pack  um men are often not portrayed in the  very flattering light they're often  portrayed as stupid and dumb and dances  and idiots  if you look at most commercials that are  peddling products the men is kind of  made to look like a  look at friend you know look at sitcoms  movies TV shows
3440,7YadPDtXY5o,52.60020755481429,65.61490533367828,so for example do you think that  a guy who desires a woman with a low  body count who doesn't have a  promiscuous past yet for example he  might be promiscuous or he's got a bunch  of women or he has a high body count do  you quarrel with that do you take an  issue with that because you mentioned  you have an issue with asymmetry do you  have an issue with that 100 like I said  I think it's your prerogative to find  someone who matches your values I'm  highly selective I want a partner who's  also highly selective I don't think that  maps onto body count because for  instance if a girl tells you like I have  80 bodies you can't deduce how selective  she is because that could be you can do  she's not selective she has 80 bodies  you can't because wouldn't you argue  women have access to [ __ ] every single  man on this planet actually sells a  99.999 curve rate 80. you're proving my  point and that means

3449,xj89dyab4JQ,53.535720383677486,69.3413929295203,think and I definitely think feminism  perpetuates that where  men are to blame for everything that's  wrong in the world and I think that's  such a tragic thing  to tell and teach especially to Young  young men who might not be able to like  really counter that in their mind  um  and it can make them feel like and  I think that's wrong and especially to  be like teaching that to  like teen boys who are teenagers I don't  even know what that stuff is yet yeah so  I think there's a lot of narratives  online in social media and in schools  that is perpetuating very negative uh  things about men which is uh  which I'm trying to Advocate against and  combat combat  um

3451,CaYpSrzXVIM,54.36728040036065,60.85370618402478,and also my recommendation to men is is  because of the dating landscape and both  men and women are doing this but  um  a lot of women are dating multiple men  uh so I don't think that you should be  adhering to your traditional gender  roles with women who  have as many options as they do and are  dating and sleeping with as many men as  they are

3462,O0kvoe7Z5ZU,50.99766260291476,59.91452773741924,but all three of you said you don't  really care about the guy's money  earlier on in the conversation so how do  you reconcile saying you don't care  about the guy's money but expecting the  guy to pay for the first date okay well  the first date is kind of different than  throughout an entire relationship like  you're asking me like long term do I  care about like him paying for  everything or like making a certain  amount of money that's different than  like okay first date like first date if  he's asking me on a date which is like  you said most women are not asking men  on a date so I'm assuming them and I  don't ask guys on dates so if he's  asking me I'm assuming he's gonna pay  because he's inviting me
